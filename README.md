## arch installation guide.

Honestly, it was hard for me to read Wiki Arch at the same time in a cli installation environment.

So I developed a personalized guide for myself.

I usually use it as follows.

``cat 1 | bash``

Some files are just a reminder of an operation.
Like file 2, which reminds of partitioning and the operation is the responsibility of the user.


'map' helps you to know what each file does.


### Attention

Parts of this guide are personalized for me and my system. Like drivers. But it might help.

be happy :)
